# Team 11 Project Part 1
Our international research health company is focused on developing methods and practices to help prevent suicide. The analytical department has been tasked with predicting trends and analyzing the correlation between economic factors, demographic variables (such as age and sex), and the number of suicide cases.

We hypothesize that economic factors significantly impact suicide rates, particularly among middle-aged and younger populations. By analyzing predictor correlations and the lag between declining economic indicators and rising suicide cases, we can forecast critical periods and identify target groups for anti-suicide campaigns. This will allow us to time interventions more effectively and tailor our strategies to those most at risk, thereby adding substantial business value by enhancing our ability to prevent suicide through data-driven decision-making.

# Columns desription
1. country - the name of the country where the data was collected.
2. year - the year in which the data was recorded.
3. sex - the gender of the individuals in the data.
4. age - the age range of the individuals in the data.
5. suicides_no - the total number of suicide cases reported in the given year and country for the specified age and sex group.
6. population - the total population of the specified age and sex group in the given country and year.
7. suicides/100k pop - the number of suicides per 100,000 individuals in the specified age and sex group.
8. country-year - a concatenated field combining the country and year for easy reference.
9. HDI for year - the Human Development Index (HDI) for the country in the given year. This is a composite statistic of life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators.
10. gdp_for_year ($) - the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country in current US dollars for the given year.
11. gdp_per_capita ($) - the GDP per capita, which is the GDP divided by the population of the country for the given year, in current US dollars.
12. generation - The generational cohort of the individuals in the data. This can reflect the cultural or historical context influencing the individuals based on their birth period.

# Scope of analysis
1. How the number of suicides varies depending on gender and age.
2. How GDP per capita affects the number of suicides.
